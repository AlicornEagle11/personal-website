        Underwater Robotics
      </h3>
      <a href="https://materovcompetition.org/" target="_blank"><b>Visit the Mate ROV Competition Website here!</b></a>
      <p>
        The MATE ROV Competition is an underwater robotics (aka remotely operated vehicle or ROV) challenge that engages a global community of learners and focuses on developing new, innovative solutions to real-world problems in the marine environment. Teams can be as small as 3 students, or much larger with over 20 students.
        <br> <br>
        For the competition, teams develop robots that can be pilot remotely to swim underwater, as well as perform various tasks such as picking up objects and moving things around. This past year, I was the Electronics/Programming Lead in my 8-person team.
